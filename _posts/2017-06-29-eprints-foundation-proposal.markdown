EPrints has a long history of supporting open access to knowledge.  Over time the environment supporting the development of the core repository software has changed.  At the User Group meeting held in Bath in December 2016, it was agreed that EPrints would benefit from having an organisation dedicated to supporting core development, community activity and identification of areas for plugin development that were desired by large sections of the user base.

A group of interested users has put together a proposal for an EPrints Foundation.  Initially, this will work to establish an organisation that can achieve the aims set out, while organising the community around a central, defined point.
