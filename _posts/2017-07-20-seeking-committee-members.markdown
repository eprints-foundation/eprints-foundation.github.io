We're looking for a few more committee volunteers.  There are several roles:

- Chair
- Secretary
- Technical Coordinator
- Community Coordinator
- Resources Coordinator
- Funding Coordinator
- Committee Members

We have some volunteers for these roles already, and if there are several volunteers for a role, I will open up discussions to agree who will do what.

Please [let us know](mailto:{{site.email}}) as soon as possible if you are interested in joining the committee and which positions you may be interested in (if any specific ones).  This group will form an acting committee to organise an inaugural general meeting to ratify the constitution and committee.
